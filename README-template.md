## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript 

### What I learned
I learnt a lot during the course of this challenge. I've always wanted to be able to create a responsive nav bar. I was able to learn how to do that by using JavaScript. I was also able to remind myself of some things I had forgotten over time. All in all, it was a great challenge for me.

### Continued development
I will keep looking for better ways to implement the nav bars and also better JavaScript practices
